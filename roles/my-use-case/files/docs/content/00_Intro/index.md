## Logs in Context

Dynatrace automatically connects the dots, putting all the data into context for you. This automation makes troubleshooting smoother and analytics more intuitive, helping teams optimize application performance with less hassle.  

Log analysis is typically the first step in the troubleshooting process. Therefore, it’s critical that when an issue arises, you have the right data and tools to quickly and easily understand the full scope of what’s happening within your applications. Dynatrace shows you your logs in context to help you quickly investigate and resolve issues.

### So, what do we mean when we say, “logs in context”?

Modern applications run in distributed environments. They generate observability data like metrics, logs and traces. Having all data in one place is often not enough because manual correlation can be required. Understanding the behavior and performance of distributed applications is important for effective troubleshooting. Dynatrace automatically connects and puts data in context for a smooth troubleshooting and analytics experience. This automated approach not only streamlines troubleshooting but also enhances the overall analytics experience, enabling teams to optimize application performance with ease. 

### Why are logs in context important?

Log analysis is typically the first step in the troubleshooting process.

Dynatrace shows you your logs in context to help you quickly investigate and resolve issues. 

In today’s session we will run through *four* different labs. These labs are: 

*	**Lab 1:** *Getting Started with Logs*
    - This lab will show you how to troubleshoot basic issues and then use Logs to confirm the issue has been resolved. 

*	**Lab 2:** *Bridging Observability Gaps* 
    - This lab will show you how to troubleshoot logs ingested from multiple sources via the API, providing you unified observability across your stack.

*	**Lab 3:** *Business Use Case*
    - This lab will show you how to bring together data from across your business and stack to answer critical business questions. 

*	**Lab 4:** *Security Use Case* 
    - This lab will show you how to investigate vulnerabilities using logs.  

### By the end of this session, you will be able to: 
•	Navigate the Log App to view and manipulate onboarded log data. 
•	Explain the power of solving complex problems through log analysis. 
•	Describe the difference between logs, metrics, and events.  
•	Summarize how logs relate to entities in Dynatrace. 

As we run through these labs we will follow a similar format.  
First, we will introduce the lab and why it is important (**know**). Then, we will show you a quick demo of how to complete the steps of the lab (**show**). Finally, we will work through the steps together, giving you a chance to gain some hands-on experience (**do**). 

Throughout the lab section, please raise your hand if you have any questions or need assistance.
